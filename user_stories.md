<span style="color:yellow;"> Ally is an undergraduate engineering student who is slightly obsessed with astrocytes and therefore has a lot of questions about them. </span><span style="color:purple;"> They have used python once or twice for simple tasks but are not particularly interested in coding or data science </span><span style="color:green;"> but would like to learn about how the structure of different brain cells may be altered in response to polycarboxybetaine methacrylate hydrogel nanoparticles carrying dead CAS9 to dampen the expression of MGMT while delivering TMZ.</span> <span style="color:blue;"> They would like to have a software that is easy to use and understand and that can help them visualize the structure of astrocytes and how it changes in response to the nanoparticles.</span>

#### 2.
<span style="color:yellow;"> Basil is a Master's student whose background is in electrical engineering.<span style="color:purple;">  He has used python for many projects but is more comfortable with C++.</span>  <span style="color:green;"> He is very much interested in the use of computer vision to analyze the structure of different cells and is a perfectionist when it comes to the quality of his images and visualizations.</span> <span style="color:blue;"> He would like to have a software where is easy to customize and tweak the filtering parameters to get the best results.</span>

#### 3.
<span style="color:yellow;"> Camron is a first year PhD student in material science.<span style="color:purple;"> He has used python for a few projects but is more comfortable with R.</span><span style="color:green;">  He is very interested in the use of machine learning to analyze how different cells interact with nanoparticles and the materials they are made from. To select nanoparticles for further study, he needs to be able to quantify the number of cells that react to his paricles.</span> <span style="color:blue;"> He needs the software to be able to analyze the structure of the cells and to be able to quantify the changes in the structure of the cells and have an interface that is easy to use.</span>

<span style="color:yellow;"> Daria is a postdoc in neuroscience. </span> <span style="color:purple;"> She has used python for many projects and is very comfortable with it.</span>  <span style="color:green;"> She is very interested in characterizing the structure of different glial subpopulations and how they change in response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide.</span> <span style="color:blue;"> She needs the software to be able to analyze the structure of the cells and to be able to quantify the changes in the structure of the cells.</span>

#### 5.
<span style="color:yellow;"> Eli is a visiting scholar from Taiwan. She has is very knowledgeable  and skilled when it comes to synthesizing nanoparticles but </span> <span style="color:purple;">is unfamiliar with python.</span>  <span style="color:yellow;"> She is planning on using lipid nanoparticles with CD55 mRNA to glial cells to see if she can reverse neuroinflammation.</span> <span style="color:green;">  Before proceeding with her project to she wants to make sure that her nanoparticles are not unintentionally inducing inflamation in the brain so she want to look at the structure of the glial cells when she adds her nanoparticles.</span> <span style="color:blue;"> She needs the software that characterizes the structure of the cells to be easy to use and to have a good user interface.</span>
