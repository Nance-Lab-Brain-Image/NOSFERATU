This repository contains the test functions for the updated VAMPIRE (Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition) program. The updated program humorously titled "" serves to extract the functions of VAMPIRE and create callable function packages and a user interface. These will allow any user interested in performing brain slice image analysis to do so more readily.

Inside this repository you will find:
- the MIT license
- the .yml and .toml for the software configuration
- the docs, example_dataset, notebooks, src, and test directories (detailed below)

docs Directory
This directory  contains documents related to the initial design process for the software package including use cases, user stories, and identified components
