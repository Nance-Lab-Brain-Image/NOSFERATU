This repository contains the test functions for the updated VAMPIRE (Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition) program. The updated program humorously titled "TURMERIC" serves to extract the functions of VAMPIRE and create callable function packages and a user interface. These will allow any user interested in performing brain slice image analysis to do so more readily.

# Inside this repository you will find:
- the MIT license
- the .yml and .toml for the software configuration
- the docs, example_dataset, notebooks, src, and test directories (detailed below)

# docs Directory 
This directory contains documents related to the initial design process for the software package including use cases, user stories, and identified components

# example_dataset Directory
This directory includes example images and expected outputs for the preprocessing.

# notebooks Directory 
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that hold the previous code from VAMPIRE as the developers work on creating the TURMERIC functions.

# src Directory 
This directory contains all of the source code for the callable functions of the TURMERIC package.

# test Directory 
This directory holds all of the test functions for each of the components. This includes functions to test if the image directory exists,
