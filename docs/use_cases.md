#### 1. Jalen's main priority for this code is learning. For users like Jalen, their main use case would be accessing, downloading, and reading the source code and documentation.

#### 2. Devonta wants to be able to use this package to present quality data. He would be inputting pictures into the program and would need a visual output of the results so that he can put them in his presentation. He would also need to be able to easily access statistical metrics such as error.

#### 3. Saquon wants to use the program to specifically probe the cell morphology of brain cell types. This program should be able to differentiate between different cell types and report quantifiable cell morphology metrics such as symmetry, size, circularity, etc.

#### 4. Cooper is hoping to use this program in his PhD studies and to improve his data science skills. For Cooper, this program would need to allow him to input and test different values for various parameters as he explores a potential hypothesis for his PhD. This package needs understandable documentation so that he can understand how his changes might affect his results. The source code also needs to be accessible and downloadable so that Cooper can download and read the code to better his understanding.

#### 5. Darius wants to use this program to segment and analyze images of cells in other biological contexts. This means that the program should be robust. The imaging techniques and metrics should not be dependent on brain contexts. At the least, the program should allow Darius to modify parameters to tailor it for other specific biological contexts. With basic coding knowledge, Darius should be able to tweak these parameters directly from the command line or using a UI so that he himself does not need to download and modify the source code.
