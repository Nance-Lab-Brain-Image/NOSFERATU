#### 1. For users like Dana, they want to use the image thresholding based on shape, but with a simple UI where they would not need to fine tune the code once it is set up. The software needs to be high throughput or at least be able to rapidly return analysis.

#### 2. For users like Emma, they need an image processing pipeline that is effective for various conditions and in different brain environments. For use at home, it needs to have enough open access that a VPN would allow users to connect remotely.

#### 3. For users like Bella, they need a software tool that rapidly diagnoses patients with minimal error. The tool would need to be able to segment more than just brain cells for tumors. A simple UI or GUI would be necessary for their skill level.

#### 4. For users like Edward, they need a software tool that retains the original image or image regions for delivering feedback while also different brain cell types. An intuitive UI would be necessary for calling functions with the image segmenting/thresholding.

#### 5. For users like Jacob, they need a database of example brain slices to practice with. Without coding experience, a simple UI or GUI with tunable parameters for image segmentation. The UI should also provide some sort of tutorial for them to follow and learn some of the coding and parameters.

#### 1. Jalen's main priority for this code is learning. For users like Jalen, their main use case would be accessing, downloading, and reading the source code and documentation.

#### 2. Devonta wants to be able to use this package to present quality data. He would be inputting pictures into the program and would need a visual output of the results so that he can put them in his presentation. He would also need to be able to easily access statistical metrics such as error.

#### 3. Saquon wants to use the program to specifically probe the cell morphology of brain cell types. This program should be able to differentiate between different cell types and report quantifiable cell morphology metrics such as symmetry, size, circularity, etc.

#### 4. Cooper is hoping to use this program in his PhD studies and to improve his data science skills. For Cooper, this program would need to allow him to input and test different values for various parameters as he explores a potential hypothesis for his PhD. This package needs understandable documentation so that he can understand how his changes might affect his results. The source code also needs to be accessible and downloadable so that Cooper can download and read the code to better his understanding.

#### 5. Darius wants to use this program to segment and analyze images of cells in other biological contexts. This means that the program should be robust. The imaging techniques and metrics should not be dependent on brain contexts. At the least, the program should allow Darius to modify parameters to tailor it for other specific biological contexts. With basic coding knowledge, Darius should be able to tweak these parameters directly from the command line or using a UI so that he himself does not need to download and modify the source code.
